## The Game itself
The game is focused on _historical events_, but also is planned to feature `Online PVP or Online PVE Story`, it's created with __[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/)__ and the code 
is written _C++_ and this means *3D-Rendering*.
The idea came from _Wargaming(**World Of Warships**)_, but this does not mean it'll not only contain around 60 ships.
